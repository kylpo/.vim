" Mac ProTips:
"  To further improve the text rendering on Mac OSX:
"  1. From the shell: defaults write org.vim.MacVim MMCellWidthMultiplier 0.9
"  2. Opens all files from other apps in vert split defaults write
"  org.vim.MacVim MMVerticalSplit YES
"  3. If when changing monitors, your fonts go from nice and thin to ugly and
"  bold: This should fix it:
"   defaults -currentHost write -globalDomain AppleFontSmoothing -int 1
"
" Cygwin:
" Tested and should work. AutoHotkey exist that provide an identical experience
" to the Mac OSX experience.
"
" Bundle System:
" Uses the NeoBundle system. Add bundles to ~/.vim/bundlesVimRc with:
" NeoBundle "git://github.com/youruser/something.git"
" Open New Vim Windows and it will ask you to install.
" Close and then reopen the vim window.

filetype plugin on " Required for NeoBundle and also good.
